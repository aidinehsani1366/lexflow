## Why AI briefings matter now

Boutique litigation teams need the same level of visibility as AmLaw giants, but rarely have a knowledge management team. After interviewing early LexFlow customers we learned that:

- 72% of partner meetings start with someone asking “where are we on this matter?”
- Most firms rely on PDF dumps before hearings, which takes hours to prepare.
- Intake data, case notes, and referral fee updates live in different tools.

LexFlow’s AI Briefing tab centralizes filings, document chats, and audit trails so you can answer those questions instantly.

## Step 1 — Upload the critical filings

Drag pleadings, motions, or discovery into the **Documents** tab. LexFlow automatically:

1. Extracts the text with our PDF/DOCX pipeline (including citations).
2. Generates searchable embeddings so the AI knows where to look.
3. Captures metadata such as document type, notes, and upload history.

> Pro tip: add a short note for context (e.g., “contains the amended answer and counterclaims”) so collaborators understand why it matters.

## Step 2 — Open the document chat

Click **Chat with AI** on any document. The panel gives you:

- Saved sessions for recurring questions (e.g., “Outline deadlines”).
- Full citations back to the PDF chunk that triggered the answer.
- Delete controls for keeping the record tidy when a matter closes.

Lawyers have been using prompts like:

\`\`\`
“Summarize the relief requested in Section II and flag related court deadlines.”
“List the factual assertions that tie to our expert witness.”
\`\`\`

Because the AI reads the document directly, you get precise answers without copy/pasting text into a generic chatbot.

## Step 3 — Switch to the AI Briefing tab

The case-level AI tab stitches together:

- Recent filings and uploads
- Calendar events and reminders
- Partner and intake activity

Ask natural-language questions like “What are the next three tasks for the Johnson matter?” and the AI will reference both document chats and the case timeline.

## Step 4 — Share with partners and associates

Invite collaborators under **Members**. Editors can upload new documents, chat with the AI, and pin key answers for future reference. Viewers stay read-only but get the exact same briefing experience during check-ins.

## What’s next
